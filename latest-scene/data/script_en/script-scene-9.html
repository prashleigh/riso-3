                    <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In the view before us we have the bridge and
                        <br/>avalanch gallery of <span class="place">Bernardino</span>. The torrent beneath
                        <br/>is spanned by a handsome bridge in connection
                        <br/>with a long gallery protects the road from
                        <br/>the dangers and ravages of the avalanches
                        <br/>—The avalanch is seen in the act
                        <br/>of falling and at once explains the nature
                        <br/>of the gallery: the gallery is perforated
                        <br/>at the side with small openings to let in
                        <br/>the light. Looking out from these, the
                        <br/>abyss they overhang seems truly awful, and
                        <br/>the roar of the water beneath with the
                        <br/>thunder of the avalanch is appalling.
                        <br/>The rocks rise on each side to a frightful
                        <br/>altitude, and in many places seem ready

                        <br/>to precipitate themselves headlong upon the
                        <br/>traveller. Of all alpine phenomen<span class="add">a</span>

      <span class="add">ed</span> by a prolonged rolling
                        <br/>noise.—high up the mountain a prodigious
                        <br/>mass of snow, ice and rock has become
                        <br/>detached and rolls down the declivities with
                        <br/>headlong fury increasing in si<span class="sic-corr">s</span>e by the
                        <br/>adherence of the snow with which it meets
                        <br/>—It then precipitates itself with frightful
                        <br/>violence into the lower districts, dragging
                        <br/>with it large masses of rocks, overwhelming
                        <br/>and destroying sometimes whole villages and
                        <br/>uprooting entire forests of trees.</p>
